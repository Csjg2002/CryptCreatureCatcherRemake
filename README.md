<p>
I am the sole programmer on this project, working on it to maintain my development skills and learn new skills I wasn't so knowledgeable on previously, such as optimisation, and adding third-party intergration like Steam and Discord.
</p>
<p>
This project has also sparked a big interest in level designing for me. The map for the game will be a big open dungeon. I have concepted up the map right now, but as we continue to finish up the tutorial I am really enjoying using subtle props in the environment to help guide the player toawrds their destination. Things like goblin footprints, destroyed walls, and caved in areas etc.
